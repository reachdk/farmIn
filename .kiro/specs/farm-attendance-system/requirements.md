# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Farm Attendance System is designed to track employee attendance for a growing farm operation. The system must operate reliably in offline conditions while providing comprehensive time tracking, configurable work categories, and administrative oversight. The solution addresses the need for accurate payroll calculations and employee management in an agricultural environment with intermittent internet connectivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farm employee, I want to clock in and out of work shifts, so that my work hours are accurately recorded for payroll purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee arrives at work THEN the system SHALL allow them to record their clock-in time
2. WHEN an employee finishes work THEN the system SHALL allow them to record their clock-out time
3. WHEN an employee clocks in THEN the system SHALL timestamp the entry with the current date and time
4. WHEN an employee clocks out THEN the system SHALL timestamp the entry with the current date and time
5. WHEN an employee clocks out THEN the system SHALL calculate the total hours worked for that shift
6. IF the system is offline THEN the system SHALL still record attendance data locally

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want to categorize work periods into configurable time categories, so that I can accurately calculate different pay rates and work classifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating work hours THEN the system SHALL categorize time into configurable categories (full day, half day, etc.)
2. WHEN an admin configures time categories THEN the system SHALL allow custom thresholds and labels
3. WHEN displaying work summaries THEN the system SHALL show hours broken down by category
4. IF work hours meet multiple category thresholds THEN the system SHALL assign the highest applicable category (e.g., 6 hours would be categorized as half day if thresholds are 4+ hours = half day, 8+ hours = full day)
5. WHEN categories are modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future entries without affecting historical data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farm owner, I want the system to work offline and sync data when connectivity is available, so that operations continue uninterrupted regardless of internet availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is offline THEN it SHALL continue to function for all core attendance operations
2. WHEN internet connectivity becomes available THEN the system SHALL automatically sync local data to the central repository
3. WHEN syncing occurs THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts and ensure data integrity
4. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and maintain local data until successful sync
5. WHEN operating offline THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of sync status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farm administrator, I want an admin interface to manage employees and system settings, so that I can maintain the system and configure it according to farm needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin functions THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication
2. WHEN managing employees THEN the admin SHALL be able to add, edit, and deactivate employee records
3. WHEN configuring time categories THEN the admin SHALL be able to set thresholds and pay classifications
4. WHEN viewing reports THEN the admin SHALL access comprehensive attendance and payroll data
5. WHEN managing sync settings THEN the admin SHALL be able to configure central repository connection details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farm manager, I want a manager interface to oversee daily operations and employee attendance, so that I can monitor workforce and address attendance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing daily attendance THEN the manager SHALL see real-time status of all employees
2. WHEN reviewing time records THEN the manager SHALL be able to make corrections with proper audit trails
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the manager SHALL access daily, weekly, and monthly attendance summaries
4. WHEN an employee has attendance issues THEN the manager SHALL receive notifications or alerts
5. IF manual adjustments are needed THEN the manager SHALL be able to modify time entries with justification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farm owner, I want the system hosted on-site without cloud dependencies, so that I maintain control over my data and ensure system availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL run entirely on local infrastructure
2. WHEN operating normally THEN the system SHALL not require internet connectivity for core functions
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use local database storage
4. IF internet is available THEN the system SHALL optionally sync to external backup locations
5. WHEN maintaining the system THEN all components SHALL be accessible and manageable locally

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic data synchronization when connectivity is available, so that backup and central reporting can occur without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate sync processes
2. WHEN syncing data THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical attendance records
3. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and sync status reports
4. IF connectivity is intermittent THEN the system SHALL handle partial syncs and resume operations
5. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide resolution mechanisms with audit trails
